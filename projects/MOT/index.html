        <h1>Multi-Object tracking</h1>
        <p><span>ShallowSORT is an online realtime approach to multiple-object tracking. Inspired by the SORT and
                DeepSORT algorithms, ShallowSORT uses colour histograms as feature desciptors to associate and track
                objects. The algorithm takes the feature extraction process online and also acheives speeds of nearly 70
                FPS running on a single core CPU. ShallowSORT has been tested on the MOTChallenge benchmark
                <a href="https://motchallenge.net/method/MOT=3356&chl=5">https://motchallenge.net/method/MOT=3356&chl=5</a> and has also been evaluated on the training KITTI
                dataset.

        <p><span>ShallowSORT uses HSV based colour histrograms as feature descriptors as compared to DeepSORT which uses
                CNN based feature descriptors. CNNs are computationally expensive and the feature extraction process
                must be either done offline or on GPUs, along with the added process of training the network against a specific set of
                clasess. By using colour histograms, we make our method class agnostic while also enabling the feature
                extraction process to be conducted online while maintaining computational efficiency.
