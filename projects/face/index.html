        <h1>Facial Identification System Using Siamese Networks</h1>
        <p><span>The Siamese Network has proven to be a simple and effective implementation of One-Shot Learning for
                Facial Recognition and Verification. For facial recognition we are given only a single image from which
                the person must be recognized. The Siamese Network compares the image feeded with those in the database
                by computing the distance between the encoding vectors of the images. If the distance is below a certain
                threshold, which can be treated as a hyperparameter, the faces are a match else not a match.

        <p><span>The benefits of using the Siamese network is that we no longer need to retrain the network everytime a
                new image is added to the database nor do we need a large dataset to train the network, which can be
                hard to obtain under these circumstances.<br />
                The Siamese Network is trained using a triplet loss function which uses 3 images, an anchor image, a
                positive image(same person as anchor) and a negative image(different person than anchor). If the
                distance between encodings of the anchor and postive image is d(A,P) and simlarly between anchor and
                negative image is d(A,N), the triplet loss function is given by:
