        <h1>Road Network Traversals Using Contraction Hierarchies</h1>
        <p>
            <span>
                Road Networks are highly dense networks when arranged in graphs as nodes and edges, and can lead to very
                high computations when finding the shortest path between 2 nodes using standard algorithms like
                Djikstra's. Contraction Hierarchies are built on the idea that to travel between destinations, we first
                move from streets to highways and bigger highways and then move back down again. This proves to be
                thousands of times faster than Djikstra and therefore more effective in real-time applications.

                Contraction Hierarchies use augmented graphs to compute the shortest paths. This consists of adding
                shortcuts by contracting less important nodes and spreading important nodes across the graph, while
                minimizing the number of edges. The node ordering plays a crucial role in preprocessing and query time.
                To obtain an optimal node ordering, a measure of importance is added to each node using hueristics and
                its order is maintained in a priority queue.
                <br /><br />The importance criteria are governed by:</span><br />
            <div style="padding-left:12px;"><span> - Edge Difference [ed(v)] = Added Shortcuts - Incoming Degree -
                    Outgoing Degree
                    <br /> - Number of Contracted Neighbours [cn(v)]
                    <br /> - Shortest Cover [sc(v)] = number of neighbours w of v that we have to shortcut to or from w
                    after contracting v
            </div><span>
                <br />Node Level [L(v)] = Upper bound on the edges in the shortest path from any node s to v in the
                augmented graph
                <br />Importance I(v) = a*ed(v) + b*cn(v) + c*sc(v) + d*L(v)
                <br /><br />By adjusting the weights of the above parameters, we can find the effect on preprocessing
                and query time to find the shortest path.
